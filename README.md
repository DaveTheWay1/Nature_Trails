# Nature Trails

## What's going on?
This project is a work in progress. Though it is nearly complete and awaits the addition of CSS for styling. It showcases my full-stack Python skills, using MySQL with Flask. However, the MySQL functionality, that used to work, is now currently broken due to a recent software update that affected the MySQL functionality. 

## What is the project about?
The project is designed for users to share places they have been that they found worth exploring, including popular nature spots and hidden gems, as well as scenic drives.  Users can comment and like shared places, and view all the shared places on the home page. I've stepped away from it as I went back to preparing to learn JavaScript, having recently received an amazing opportunity to receive a scholarship for an Adobe x General Assembly bootcamp. 

## Future Advancements!
For further advancement, after fixing the MySQL issue and including CSS, I aim to enhance the project's interactivity and organization. This includes creating separate web pages for hidden gems, scenic spots, and other categories. Additionally, I plan to facilitate an easy way for users to connect selected locations to their maps application for directions. Furthermore, I intend to add nearby restaurants for users to share and possibly enable the capability to share entire adventures for others to follow. Enjoy, and please be patientâ€”a hero's journey is in the works!
